# Narrative Stele Prototype

A lightweight, multilingual web prototype for an interactive “Narrative Stele” experience. Visitors begin on a language-selection landing page and proceed into a storytelling interface designed for gallery use. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What is a “Narrative Stele”?

In the exhibition context, a Narrative Stele is an interpretive, character-driven interaction point: visitors “approach” a stele and trigger a short narrative encounter. The stele format supports:

- **Polyvocal interpretation** (multiple historical voices / perspectives)
- **Guided choices** (branching prompts that keep the experience readable in-gallery)
- **Multilingual access** (built-in language switching)

This GitHub Pages build currently starts with a **language selector** for **English / 繁體中文 / 简体中文**. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
